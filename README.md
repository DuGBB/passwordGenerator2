# Password Generator
## 03 JavaScript

Week three's challenge goal was to create a JavaScript driven random
password generator

I did this by:
- creating arrays to hold the character choices
- create a function to hold the random generation logic
- create while loop to validate user input
- create conditional expression variables
- create variable to to assign action to the character requirements
- create loop selection for random array characters for password
- create function to write generated password to screen
